# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores the famous Iris dataset to practice several Machine Learning techniques. The objective is to implement dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification algorithms while performing a comparative analysis of their performance.

## Objectives
1. Dimensionality reduction using **PCA**.
2. Unsupervised clustering with **K-means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.
3. Supervised classification using **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**.
4. Comparative analysis of results across methods.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Iris Dataset
- **Source**: Fisher, R.A. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."
- **Description**: 
  - The dataset consists of 150 samples divided into three classes of iris plants: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
  - Each sample has four attributes:
    - Sepal length
    - Sepal width
    - Petal length
    - Petal width
  - One class is linearly separable from the others; the other two are not linearly separable.
- **File type**: `.data` (CSV-like format)
- **Missing values**: None
